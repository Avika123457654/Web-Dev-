## 🛠️ Module 02: Function Architecture

Functions are more than just blocks of code in JS; they are "First-Class Citizens."

### Key Learnings:
* **The Hoisting Secret:** The difference between Function Declarations (fully hoisted) and Function Expressions (not hoisted).
* **Lexical `this`:** Why Arrow Functions are the preferred choice for callbacks inside objects to maintain the correct context.
* **Encapsulation (IIFE):** Using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions to create private scopes and avoid global namespace pollution.
* **The Rest Operator:** Handling dynamic inputs efficiently using `...args`.
