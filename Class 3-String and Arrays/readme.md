### Key Learnings:
* **Stack vs. Heap:** * **Stack:** Static memory allocation for Primitives (Strings, Numbers).
    * **Heap:** Dynamic memory allocation for Objects and Arrays.
* **The Immutability Trap:** Proof that string methods like `.toUpperCase()` create new strings rather than modifying the original.
* **Reference Management:** Mastering the difference between **Shallow Copies** (linking nested objects) and **Deep Copies** (complete isolation).
